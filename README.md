 My hangman game is an interactive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers players an entertaining and challenging experience as they attempt to guess a secret word by inputting letters one at a time. With visually appealing designs and engaging animations, the game creates an immersive environment. Players can choose from various difficulty levels, allowing both beginners and seasoned word enthusiasts to enjoy the game. The interface offers feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying a hangman figure whose parts are gradually filled in as incorrect guesses accumulate.
